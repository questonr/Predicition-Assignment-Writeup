# Summary

This document is the final report of the Peer Assessment project from the Practical Machine Learning course, which is a part of the Coursera John’s Hopkins University Data Science Specialization. It was written and coded in RStudio, using its knitr functions and published in the html and markdown format. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the six participants performed the exercises. The machine learning algorithm, which uses the classe variable in the training set, is applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data.

#Introduction

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

# Loading and Cleaning of Data

Set working directory with setwd()

Load required R packages and set a seed.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(corrplot)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)
library(RColorBrewer)

set.seed(1234)
```

Load data for training and test datasets.

```{r}
url_train <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
url_quiz  <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

data_train <- read.csv(url(url_train), strip.white = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA",""))
data_quiz  <- read.csv(url(url_quiz),  strip.white = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA",""))

dim(data_train)
dim(data_quiz)
```

Create two partitions (75% and 25%) within the original training dataset.

```{r}
in_train  <- createDataPartition(data_train$classe, p=0.75, list=FALSE)
train_set <- data_train[ in_train, ]
test_set  <- data_train[-in_train, ]

dim(train_set)
dim(test_set)
```

The two datasets (train_set and test_set) have a large number of NA values as well as near-zero-variance (NZV) variables. Both will be removed together with their ID variables.

```{r}
nzv_var <- nearZeroVar(train_set)

train_set <- train_set[ , -nzv_var]
test_set  <- test_set [ , -nzv_var]

dim(train_set)
dim(test_set)
```

Remove variables that are mostly NA. A threshlod of 95 % is selected.

```{r}
na_var <- sapply(train_set, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.95
train_set <- train_set[ , na_var == FALSE]
test_set  <- test_set [ , na_var == FALSE]

dim(train_set)

dim(test_set)
```

Since columns 1 to 5 are identification variables only, they will be removed as well.

```{r}
train_set <- train_set[ , -(1:5)]
test_set  <- test_set [ , -(1:5)]

dim(train_set)

dim(train_set)
```

The number of variables for the analysis has been reduced from the original 160 down to 54.

# Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis between the variables before the modeling work itself is done. The “FPC” is used as the first principal component order.

```{r}
corr_matrix <- cor(train_set[ , -54])
corrplot(corr_matrix, order = "FPC", method = "circle", type = "lower",
         tl.cex = 0.6, tl.col = rgb(0, 0, 0))
```

If two variables are highly correlated their colors are either dark blue (for a positive correlation) or dark red (for a negative correlations). Because there are only few strong correlations among the input variables, the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) will not be performed in this analysis. Instead, a few different prediction models will be built to have a better accuracy.

# Prediction Models

## Decision Tree Model

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
fit_decision_tree <- rpart(classe ~ ., data = train_set, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(fit_decision_tree)
```

Predictions of the decision tree model on test_set.

```{r}
predict_decision_tree <- predict(fit_decision_tree, newdata = test_set, type="class")
conf_matrix_decision_tree <- confusionMatrix(predict_decision_tree, factor(test_set$classe))
conf_matrix_decision_tree
```

The predictive accuracy of the decision tree model is relatively low at 75.2 %.

Plot the predictive accuracy of the decision tree model.

```{r}
plot(conf_matrix_decision_tree$table, col = conf_matrix_decision_tree$byClass, 
     main = paste("Decision Tree Model: Predictive Accuracy =",
                  round(conf_matrix_decision_tree$overall['Accuracy'], 4)))
```

# Generalized Boosted model (GBM)

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
ctrl_GBM <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 5, repeats = 2)
fit_GBM  <- train(classe ~ ., data = train_set, method = "gbm",
                  trControl = ctrl_GBM, verbose = FALSE)
fit_GBM$finalModel
```

Predictions of the GBM on test_set.

```{r}
predict_GBM <- predict(fit_GBM, newdata = test_set)
conf_matrix_GBM <- confusionMatrix(predict_GBM, factor(test_set$classe))
conf_matrix_GBM
```

The predictive accuracy of the GBM is relatively high at 98.57 %.

# Random Forest Model

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
ctrl_RF <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 5, repeats = 2)
fit_RF  <- train(classe ~ ., data = train_set, method = "rf",
                  trControl = ctrl_RF, verbose = FALSE)
fit_RF$finalModel
```

Predictions of the random forest model on test_set.

```{r}
predict_RF <- predict(fit_RF, newdata = test_set)
conf_matrix_RF <- confusionMatrix(predict_RF, factor(test_set$classe))
conf_matrix_RF
```

The predictive accuracy of the Random Forest model is excellent at 99.8 %.

# Applying the Best Predictive Model to the Test Data

The following are the predictive accuracy of the three models:

Decision Tree Model: 75.20 %
Generalized Boosted Model: 98.57 %
Random Forest Model: 99.80 %

The Random Forest model is selected and applied to make predictions on the 20 data points from the original testing dataset (data_quiz).

```{r}
predict_quiz <- as.data.frame(predict(fit_RF, newdata = data_quiz))
predict_quiz
```

# Assumptions

The statistical analyses performed in this report are based on several key assumptions.

1. **Independence of Observations**: It is assumed that the measurements of tooth growth in guinea pigs are independent of each other. This implies that the growth observed in one guinea pig does not influence or is not influenced by the growth in another.

2. **Normality**: The t-tests used in this analysis assume that the tooth lengths, particularly the means of these lengths, follow a normal distribution. This assumption is more reliable when the sample size is large, due to the Central Limit Theorem. However, for smaller sample sizes or skewed data, this assumption might not hold, which can affect the reliability of the test results.

3. **Equality of Variances**: While the Welch’s t-test, used in our analysis, does not assume equal variances between groups, it's still important to note that significant differences in variances can affect the interpretation of the test results.

4. **Random Sampling**: The analysis presumes that the data points in the ToothGrowth dataset are a random sample from the population of interest. This is crucial for the generalizability of the results.

5. **Scale of Measurement**: The data for tooth length should be on an interval or ratio scale, which is a precondition for conducting t-tests.
